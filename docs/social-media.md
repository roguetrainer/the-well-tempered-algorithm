# **Option 1: The "Storyteller" (Focus on the Concept)**

**Headline: What if Bach had access to a GPU? 🎹🤖**

I’m excited to share a new open-source project: **The Well-Tempered Algorithm**.

We often treat Generative AI as a "black box"—you put a prompt in, and magic comes out. But to really understand it, you need to see how the technology evolved.

This project is a hands-on Python workshop that teaches AI history through the lens of J.S. Bach's music. We don't just jump to the latest model; we build the intuition layer by layer:

🎲 **Phase 1: Probability.** We use Markov Chains to teach the computer "texture." It sounds like Bach, but wanders aimlessly like a musician with amnesia.

🧠 **Phase 2: Memory.** We introduce LSTMs (Recurrent Neural Networks) to give the AI short-term memory, allowing it to hold onto musical motifs.

🗣️ **Phase 3: Language.** Finally, we implement a GPT-2 Transformer. We treat notes like words and phrases like sentences, using Self-Attention to capture the complex architecture of a fugue.

The code is fully documented and runs directly in Google Colab. Perfect for musicians curious about code, or coders curious about music theory.

# **Option 2: The "Technical" (Focus on the Stack)**

**Headline: From Markov Chains to Transformers: A Python Workshop**

I've just open-sourced **The Well-Tempered Algorithm**, a repo designed to teach algorithmic composition using modern Python stacks.

It serves as a practical playground for comparing three distinct architectures for sequence generation:

1. **N-Gram Models:** Pure probabilistic generation using music21 for corpus analysis.  
2. **RNNs/LSTMs:** Sequence prediction using TensorFlow/Keras.  
3. **Transformers:** Tokenized music generation using Hugging Face's TFGPT2LMHeadModel.

The goal isn't just to generate music, but to visualize *why* modern architectures (like Transformers) outperform previous methods in capturing long-term structure and dependencies.

The entire workshop is available as a Jupyter Notebook.

# **Option 3: Short & Visual (Best for mobile)**

**Headline: Teaching AI to speak "Bach" 🎼**

I built a workshop called **The Well-Tempered Algorithm**. It's a journey through the history of AI music generation.

We start with simple probability (Markov Chains), move to Deep Learning (LSTMs), and finish with the architecture behind ChatGPT (Transformers)—all trained on Bach's chorales.

It's amazing to see the difference in output:  
❌ Markov: Good texture, no structure.  
✅ Transformer: Understands phrasing and resolution.
