# Option 1: The "Storyteller" (Focus on the Concept)

🎹🤖 BACH TO THE FUTURE: GENERATIVE AI MEETS BAROQUE
🎵 REFACTORING THE FUGUE: LSTM VS. TRANSFORMER PERFORMANCE ON POLYPHONY.

To find out why MARKOV CHAINS fail at Counterpoint (and how TRANSFORMERS fix it) try THE WELL-TEMPERED ALGORITHM.

This experiment demonstrates AI history through the lens of J.S. Bach's music. We don't just jump to a state-of-the-art generative model; we build the intuition layer by layer:

🎲 PHASE 1: PROBABILITY. We use MARKOV CHAINS to teach the computer "texture." It sounds vaguely like Bach, but wanders aimlessly like a musician with amnesia. 

N-GRAM MODELS: Pure probabilistic generation using music21 for corpus analysis. 

🧠 PHASE 2: MEMORY. We introduce LSTMs (RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS) to give the AI SHORT-TERM MEMORY, allowing it to hold onto musical motifs.

RNNs/LSTMs: Sequence prediction using TensorFlow/Keras.

🗣️ PHASE 3: LANGUAGE. Finally, we implement a GPT-2 TRANSFORMER. We treat notes like words and phrases like sentences, using Self-Attention to capture the complex architecture of a fugue.

TRANSFORMERS: Tokenized music generation using Hugging Face's TFGPT2LMHeadModel.

The code is documented and runs directly in Google Colab or locally. Could be for musicians curious about code, or coders curious about music theory. 🤨

From random.choice() to MultiHeadAttention. Let's take a 300-year journey to make AI "speak" Bach.

# Option 2: The "Technical" (Focus on the Stack)

Headline: From Markov Chains to Transformers: A Python Workshop

I've just open-sourced The Well-Tempered Algorithm, a repo designed to teach algorithmic composition using modern Python stacks.

It serves as a practical playground for comparing three distinct architectures for sequence generation:

1. N-Gram Models: Pure probabilistic generation using music21 for corpus analysis.  
2. RNNs/LSTMs: Sequence prediction using TensorFlow/Keras.  
3. Transformers: Tokenized music generation using Hugging Face's TFGPT2LMHeadModel.

The goal isn't just to generate music, but to visualize *why* modern architectures (like Transformers) outperform previous methods in capturing long-term structure and dependencies.

The entire workshop is available as a Jupyter Notebook.

# Option 3: Short & Visual (Best for mobile)

Headline: Teaching AI to speak "Bach" 🎼

I built a workshop called The Well-Tempered Algorithm. It's a journey through the history of AI music generation.

We start with simple probability (Markov Chains), move to Deep Learning (LSTMs), and finish with the architecture behind ChatGPT (Transformers)—all trained on Bach's chorales.

It's amazing to see the difference in output:  
❌ Markov: Good texture, no structure.  
✅ Transformer: Understands phrasing and resolution.

# Titles
Here are several attention-grabbing headline options for your social media post, categorized by the "vibe" they project:

### The Provocative Hooks
* Does ChatGPT have a soul? Asking for J.S. Bach.
* I taught a neural network to write counterpoint. It’s... complicated.
* The ghost in the machine plays the Harpsichord.
* Can an algorithm feel religious ecstasy? Testing AI on Bach Chorales.

### The Technical & Geeky
* From `random.choice()` to `MultiHeadAttention`: A 300-year journey.
* Forget LLMs. Let’s talk about LAMs (Large Audio Models) and Baroque theory.
* Refactoring the Fugue: LSTM vs. Transformer performance on polyphony.
* Why Markov Chains fail at Counterpoint (and how Transformers fix it).

### The Educational & Clear
* Learn Generative AI by composing Classical Music.
* Stop treating AI like a black box. Open the lid and see the gears.
* A crash course in AI history, taught by Johann Sebastian Bach.
* The Hello World of AI Music: Building a Bach Bot from scratch.

### The Punny & Playful
* Bach to the Future: Generative AI meets 18th Century Baroque.
* If it ain't Baroque, don't fix it (but maybe train a model on it).
* De-composing the Greats: An AI experiment.
* The Well-Tempered Algorithm: Tuning Neural Nets.

My personal recommendation:
Combine a provocative question with a clear benefit.
